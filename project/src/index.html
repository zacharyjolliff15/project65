    Problem 1: The Book Class
    Objective: Create a simple class to represent a book and instantiate objects from it.
    
    Task:
    
    Define a class named Book.
    
    Give the Book class three attributes: title (string), author (string), and numberOfPages (integer).
    
    Create a constructor for the Book class that accepts title, author, and 
    numberOfPages as arguments and initializes the corresponding attributes of the object being created.
    
    Instantiate (create) at least two different Book objects using your 
    constructor, providing different details for each book.
    
    (Optional) Add a method displayInfo() that prints the book's details in a readable format 
    (e.g., "Title: [title], Author: [author], Pages: [numberOfPages]").
     Call this method on your created objects.
